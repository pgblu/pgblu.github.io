      <p>I am embarking on an exploration of git, and now I want to let you in on what's going on.</p>

<p>Git is a tool for keeping track of the evolution of your code, no matter how deep and complex its evolution has been. This is made possible through a method of version control that keeps track of the code in terms of 'snapshots.' As you might know, the process of producing a coding project of any significant scope is a topsy-turvy sort of affair, and it's helpful to be able, at any time, to go back and look at older versions of your code, in order to look at features you might have discarded.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of this version control is about as convenient as you can imagine: from your command line you can select directories for that you'd like git to manage, ask git to list those files that are not up-to-date within git, and then commit whatever files you've added or edited since your last interaction with git in that directory.</p>

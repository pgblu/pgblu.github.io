    <h1>Conflict resolution</h1>
    <h2>Theory vs. practice</h2>
    <p>I'm the last person to give anyone advice on conflict resolution. I don't deal well with conflict, in fact I get very defensive and start reaching for mindless tasks. In fact, if I had more conflicts in my life right now I'd have a lot less trouble working on this blog: it seems like just the right mental place for shutting everything else out.</p>
    <p>Most of my past conflicts are much too personal for a public blog. The ones that aren't too personal are too banal to be of much value for closer analysis.</p>
    <p>I have witnessed conflicts between other parties, and have even been a middleman in said conflicts in the past. Let's talk about those! The conflicts that really persist tend to have their source in a difference of perspective, one which somehow affects one or the other party's <em>self</em>-perception. Thus the fear of injury to one's pride can often play a larger role than the purported point of contention.</p>
    <p>In such situations, a middle-person can play an important role, because they provide an external perspective and a relatively neutral one. They can help the stubborn and/or injured party in the conflict see themselves from the outside and recognize that their pride is less important than harmony.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the middle-person has the special privilege of being practically unable to actually make things worse, can play the hero/ine, and can pat him/herself on the back for making the world a better place. It increases his/her ability to push conflict away from themselves, mostly by refusing to recognize the seriousness of their own actual conflicts.</p>
    <p>Those that play the middle-person can stop patting themselves on the back and start opening their eyes to where they themselves stand in their relationships.</p>

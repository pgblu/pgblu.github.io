      <h1>Cognition and identity</h1>
      <h2>One perspective on Steele's research presentation</h2>
      <p>I was very grateful for the opportunity to become acquainted with the research of Provost Claude Steele from Columbia University (now at UC Berkeley), which was made available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">here</a> (2010) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piR_yKVvmQg">here</a> (2014). His experiments and those of his colleagues gave concrete reinforcement of assumptions that have been lurking in discourses on identity for as long as I can remember. I've grown up assuming that racial, gender, and other, less visible identity characteristics have a strong impact on self-perception and behavior in various situations. The results and reactions are complex to describe, yet the brief exposition did a good job of providing an initial overview of some of these complexities.</p>
      <p>It is not hard to convince people that intellectual development is best fostered in a nurturing environment, and it's probably not a stretch to also assert that students whose identities are stereotyped negatively are best served by a more proactive definition of 'nurturing'. But it's still something of a cold reality check whenever I encounter the concrete data that comes from research of this kind. There is little doubt, based on Dr. Steele's findings, that these effects are very real and insidious.</p>
      <p>The idea, though, that one can neutralize these effects so strongly simply by uttering a few words seems rather hard to believe. I see in this two dangers. For one, it makes the notion of identity seem far more superficial than it really is. Can the performance gap really be closed - as the graphs suggested - simply by defusing the pressure with a few choice words? It would be a welcome thing if so. But I cannot but be skeptical of the methodology when I see how the self-perception-induced gaps vanish under the experimental circumstances.</p>
      <p>In addition, like so many other sociological researchers, Dr Steele undertakes his research with respect to race, gender, body image, age, and other external markers rather than focusing on a single attribute. This is done, on an academic-strategic level, for the sake of demonstrating the extensibility and applicability of the findings. However, I've long been concerned that lumping all these dimensions of (potential) discrimination together may tend to re-inforce perceptions that stereotype pressure exists and behaves predictably, and independently of which dimension is actually in play.</p>
      <p>The consequences of these dangers are a bit obvious: if one takes the suggested steps to counteract stereotype pressues, what is one to do if the gap does <em>not</em> close? Should we draw from this the conclusion that the stereotypes <em>are</em> justified? As always, these conclusions, which seem too pat, need to be carefully parsed by a thoughtful listener: the mechanisms of negative self-perception may in many cases be too complex to be overcome with mere talking or manipulation of external parameters of the social situation. The right conclusion is not that stereotype pressure can be alleviated if we just try a little harder, but that stereotype pressure simply <em>exists</em>, it needs to be acknowledged, and we need to do the best we can to respect its effects and take them into account when interacting with people.</p>
      <p>Some people pat themselves on the back for being tolerant and sensitive to the Other, which I admit I have done often in the past. But even the most tolerant and considerate white male has never been anything other than that. Analogously with what I've said above, traveling to an exotic country (the example that came up in Dr Steele's talk was Lagos, Nigeria) where one's own identity is the minority, might take us some distance in better understanding the experience of the Other, but it is not a replacement for <em>being</em> the other. The only reliable principle to hold oneself to is to listen carefully and react to each potentially contentious situation as if it was unique -- rather than rely on abstract experimental conclusions to turn it into a stereotypical situation. Armed with the knowledge offered by Dr Steele's findings, each individual is still obligated to gather real-world experiences and draw upon as many resources, cues, and pieces of feedback as possible in order to ascertain the right way forward.</p>

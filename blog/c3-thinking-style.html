      <h1>Thinking style and learning style</h1>
      <p>I've never been particularly good at self-analysis, and the last three weeks haven't done much to improve my skills in this regard. When I took the <a href="www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc personal thinking style quiz</a>, I found myself in the 'little of this, little of that' category. If I can't solve a problem one way, I approach it from the opposite side. I recognize where my comfort zones are, and when I am slipping into them.</p>
      <p>It has been interesting to try and compare my html/css process with my Ruby coding process. I enjoy the latter much more than the former, and I think this is because I like objective answers to things.</p>
      <p>Getting a piece of code, with many interdependencies, to work is very satisfying because — once the pseudocode is pristine — every piece of the puzzle can be separately tested, and with enough time, the picture will be complete.</p>
      <p>With an html page, however, it's difficult to know where to begin working. To a novice, a simple blog template, where the text goes in later, is unsettling to work with, because not only do changes in the text prompt a reassessment of the template — and vice versa — but the criteria for both are 'soft'. The abstract approach or the concrete approach, the random vs. the sequential approach... these attitudes which complement each other so well when working with code seem to turn the website design process into a muddle, at least for my experience.</p>
      <p>My only resource right now is patience. I will bravely chip away at this vile sculpture of a blog over the next couple of months.</p>

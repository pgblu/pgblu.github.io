      <h1>Real world problems</h1>
      <h2>and how tech addresses them (or not)</h2>
      <p>Silicon Valley and its clones around the country and the world are primarily focussed on developing viable businesses. The operative question is: how can I pay my employees competitively and ensure a return to my investors?</p>
      <p>Of course, all industries are organized in this manner, and it seems pollyannaish to suggest that things ought to change. Still, considering the potential of technology to lead the way in uncovering the causes and solutions to real-world problems, it seems that every time someone obtains funding for yet another new social network, one might be forgiven wondering if that startup money might not be better spent on creating solutions for environmental problems or institutionalized bigotry.</p>
      <p>To be sure, philanthropic causes have been addressed in the tech world, and to accuse the coding community of living in a bubble is to succumb to a rather unfair stereotype. Awareness of social and ecological causes among the tech sector is (I speculate!) higher than in the average population. However, it seems that the kinds of initiatives that grab headlines for their social value are too little, too late, or few and far between... I conceive you may use any cliche you choose... Whether you organize a hackathon or you allocate resources for weekend keyboard-warriors to devote their intellectual power to crowdsourcing poverty alleviation initiatives, your well-deserved pat on the back may tend to obscure the fact that all that is being done, so far, is a collective drop in the bucket.</p>
      <p>In this environment, the big firms such as Yahoo, Google, or Facebook need to be more frank about the ineffectiveness of merely informing oneself and one's peers by signing petitions or distributing social-consciousness clickbait. It's not enough that awareness of environmental issues or economic disparities spreads, but we must also be aware that awareness is not enough.</p>
      <p>The U.S. citizenry is not accustomed to collective action, let alone to government-mandated changes in attitude -- for better or worse, our societal attitudes are biased toward scattered energy and ephemeral, short-attention-span-rewarding undertakings. I don't know a solution to this problem, and I am relatively pessimistic about whether the principles of spontaneous self-organization found in nature (see illustration) will happen in society. It's a cool idea, but people are not starlings...</p>
      <p>Can we strike a balance between the US-American concept of individual liberty and the need, more urgent than ever, for unified action? Bwuh? Oh, look, a squirrel!</p>

    <h1>My values</h1>
    <h2>Let's hash it out!</h2>
    <p>I am a musician by trade, and in my field we are meant to take professional pride in our ability to listen. It is not always the case, however, that an ability to listen to and analyze <em>sounds</em> translates into the ability to listen to words, feelings, and subtexts. I learned about this disconnect only in the last few years and have needed to broaden my conception of what it means to be a 'good listener.'</p>
    <p>The biggest leaps forward in this understanding have taken place because I am a husband and a father. Living in close quarters with people in whose well-being you have an enormous stake means that you can't get far unless you're as honest and open as you can be. </p>
    <p>So today, one of my pillar values is to seek to understand the position of others, and what I can do to facilitate a better communication. Needless to say, I catch myself making assumptions more often than I'd like, but it's also clear that the instincts that lead me to short-circuit the listening process are stubborn - I shouldn't beat myself up about it. Every day is another chance to get better.</p>
    <p>So much for living in harmony with others... what about inner harmony? It's not a quality I think much about, at least not very concretely. What keeps me striving forward is that I've grown up in incredibly fortunate circumstances, with a family that gave me everything I needed to succeed. If I fail, it really isn't something I can blame on people other than myself.</p>
    <p>I am not entirely convinced by Professor Steele's theories, as I outlined rather superficially in an earlier post. I would, however, agree on one point: just as stereotypes can color your view of the world and of your fate, socio-economic status is an incredibly fraught ingredient in one's identity. As with race, gender, religion, and other such attributes, it's one that can't be dismissed with a few strategically timed and formulated words.</p>
    <p>Long story short: I am a beneficiary of white privilege. Counting my blessings is what keeps me grounded. Knowing my responsibilities is what keeps me moving.</p>

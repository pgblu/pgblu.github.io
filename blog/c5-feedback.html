      <h2>Gimme feedback or nothing at all</h2>
      <p>Week 5 of Dev Boot Camp has come to an end, and despite having had about a dozen pairing sessions, I'm not completely sold on the idea of pair programming at all. It would be silly to reject it out of hand, of course -- for that I'm both too green and not judgmental enough -- but there are at least a few scenarios where I've found pair programming to be somewhere in the spectrum between counterproductive and downright annoying. Fortunately, all of my colleagues were extremely pleasant (exception: see below), so my annoyance was never with them... just with the process, and that only occasionally.</p>
      <p>When you're refactoring code, it's nice to do it with someone who really knows the methods better than you do. But if both of you are clueless or you're the more experienced one, it's very hard to keep the conversation really two-sided. Instead it tends to become a monologue.</p>
      <p>When you go into the console to test out methods etc., there's also usually nothing for the pair to do, and driver-navigator roles just feel like busywork.</p>
      <p>It seems to me that when we have larger projects with lots of dependencies and extensive driver coding or rspec-ing to do, there will be more opportunities to compartmentalize the work in a way that keeps everyone involved. For now, we are pairing because we can and because DBC would like us to develop pairing habits for when we need them someday. In this respect, the aforementioned (occasional) annoyance becomes much easier to put up with.</p>
      <p>Providing feedback for pairing sessions is not always easy, especially if you're not a fan of writing boilerplate in response to the typical, fairly routine pairing session. If, however, you see the feedback submission as an opportunity to encapsulate your impressions of the session <em>for your future self to read</em> and worry less about the feelings of your pair, you might just find the process more useful. I guess that's just if you're me.</p>
      <p>For my very first pairing sessions, I got a surprisingly negative and prickly review. I got 'dinged' for hemming and hawing, and I felt the characterization of my behavior was quite noticeably at odds with my memory of it all. Please gimme a break, anonymous partner ... given that I had never communicated in this manner before, it's a wonder I didn't, metaphorically speaking, vomit a pile of quivering jello.</p>
      <p>Thank you and good day.</p>

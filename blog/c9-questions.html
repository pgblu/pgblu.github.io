    <p>Stack Overflow has been around since 2008, and today belongs to a vast network of question-and-answer sites known as Stack Exchange, although the latter did not become a unified entity until 2011. Since it's an open forum where anyone can contribute, it has its community problems, but on the whole—especially compared to those who post comments on youTube, for example—it's a well-behaved bunch, and spending time there can be very rewarding.</p>
    <p>2008! You'll notice: that's a very short history, even shorter than the history of coding camps. Yet already it feels like these communities have been around forever, which may be a function of the size of the hole that they filled in the web's overall cultural landscape.</p>
    <p>What makes a good Stack Overflow question? This has been asked many times, even on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">Stack Overflow FAQ</a>, where you'll get great information and links to further reading.</p>
    <p>What it comes down to is this: pretend you're an experienced programmer whose first web visit in the morning is to Stack Overflow. Let's assume you're not there to just garner reputation, but because you want to help people. (The former kind of expert, I assert, is much less common than people seem to think.) How would you want to see questions formulated? Do you want to be distracted by poor grammar, confused by unclear or lacking examples, or bothered with questions that can easily be answered by Google?</p>

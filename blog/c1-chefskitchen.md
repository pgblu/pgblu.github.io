# Pacing oneself
#### and other unfamiliar things
#### Sept. 20, 2014

Shereef Bishay is a highly personable and articulate guy, and I get the sense he deeply cares about his boots. His joy in the DBC experience is infectious and genuine, and it's clear that he has thought deeply about the experience of novices. The analogy to learning musical scales was particularly evocative, and made me think quite a bit. I know myself to be an impatient learner, unaccustomed to struggling with concepts... but not because I am at the pinnacle of human cognition (far from it!) but because I have been adept at seeking out the things that I'm already good at and making small steps within that domain, rather than exiting my comfort zone and working hard at something that my brain resists!  

I also appreciate that he took the time to address questions about the way the industry is changing. I think the latter is one of the most critical questions of our time, and one that worries me a great deal. It seems that Web development is a kind of bubble, and that the job market must be getting steadily tougher. It's nice to know that the curriculum has been getting more dense, ie. that so much of what used to be Phase 1 or 2 has been sluiced into the Phase 0 and Prep phases. I forgot what else I wanted to say here.

The industry is moving extremely fast. It's clear that a 4-year computer science curriculum, for all its advantages, may not be as well-equipped to prepare students for this changing environment. In the middle of our cohort, some fantastic new computer language might come up that, in an extreme case, makes Ruby nearly obsolete. (That's a bit extreme, I admit) Thus it was reassuring to think through the architecture analogy. A good engineer is like a good architect, in that he/she thinks not just about the materials but the experience of living in a space, interacting with that space and the other people in it; in short, you're not just a professional, you're also a person.

Shereef has a wonderful sense of humor as well... you know your brain is finished for the day when you're calling your programming pair "Mom." I am convinced that that will never happen to me.

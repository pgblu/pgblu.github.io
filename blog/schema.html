    <p>Hey friends, what do you think of my schema?</p>
    <p>A tourney has many rounds and many players through 'Signups'; it can be a Swiss system, a classic elimination, or a round robin-type tourney. In the last case, it can be single or double r.r. (either two matches per pair of players or only one match).</p>
    <p>A round has many matches, and belongs to one tourney.</p>
    <p>A match has two players; a result of 'white', 'black', or 'draw'; and it belongs to a round.</p>
    <p>A player has a name and a rating, has many matches and many signups to tourneys.</p>
    <p>A signup belongs to one player and one tourney. It keeps track of the player's wins losses and draws for that tourney & retrieves the player's standing in that tourney.</p>
    <p>Questions: (1) is the signup table superfluous? Its primary function is as a join table between tourneys and players (each of which has many of the other), but the data in the table is primarily specific to the player rather than to the tourney. (2) Is the 'standing' field in the signup -- being a 'derived attribute' -- actually necessary? It might be a method on the Player class instead, which would be dependent on the Signup record's data. (3) Is the schema robust? Can you think of any trouble I might get into?</p>

    <h5>Setup</h5>
    <p>To achieve the desired spatial effects, the violinist should sit all the way upstage left [house right], while the cello is far downstage to the right [house left], facing the other wall - i.e., neither facing the violin nor the audience; if the space is small the cellist should be to the [house] left of, or even behind, the audience.</p>

          <p>All pitches are notated in accordance with the standard fingering, with the string indicated in Roman numerals; where fingering diverges from the sounding result, the latter is indicated in standard tuning. In the smaller staff above, one can read the actual resultant pitches.</p>
          <p>The timbral difference between equivalent pitches, in part called forth through unconventional playing techniques, can only be realized if all strings are natural gut, of which only the lowest ones are wound.</p>

                  <td>= "fawsetts," a harmonic technique discovered by R. Fawsett which enables a rapid sequence (e.g., even scales) of harmonics: two harmonic-pressure fingerings result in the pitch an octave and a fifth above the upper finger's location. This can only be achieved through a continuous bow speed at the usual arco-position (about 1/6 of the string length between the upper finger and the bridge; the lower finger's position is irrelevant -- it only serves to prevent the creation of a self-contained vibrating system, and can remain in place while the upper finger's position changes). This technique was extended in the following manner: when the bow position moves toward the bridge, the next higher tones in the overtone series can be produced; when moving sul tasto, it's the lower tones in the series; if the result (<span id="bullet">&bull;</span>) is identical to the expressly notated finger position (<img width="60px" src="imgs/img05.png" alt="">), then the string is being bowed approxinately halfway between the finger and the bridge. If the result is the octave (2. overtone), then the bow location is 1/4 (sul tasto), for the twelfth (3. overtone) = 1/6 (ordinario), double-octave (4th overtone) = 1/8 (poco sul pont.) etc. The higher tones will naturally be progressively more difficult to find and (given a steady bow movement) maintain; that's why they are only seldom used (cf. 7th and 8th overtone in Vcl, part VI, m. 26).</td>

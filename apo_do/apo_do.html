  <h1>Rhythm and Duration</h1>
  <p>A combination of space- and conventional rhythm notation. The beat- and barlines represent the units of time (usually seconds). The density and distances on the page correspond to density and distance in time. The rhythms are also notated conventionally, so as to assure a certain precision, especially in the longer pauses. Only the longest general pauses are grouped together (indicated by a number of seconds or measures). Actions which remain the same for more than one measure are, where difficult to represent in conventional pitch-notation, are represented by duration lines that extend across the bars; I have refrained from notating the duration values in full measures. If such actions do not end at a barline, then their precise duration is expressed through a duration value or through the subsequent rest values.</p>

  <h1>Pitches</h1>
  <p>To avoid the constant use of clef changes and ledger lines, a single instrument will occasionally be shown on two staves:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="imgs/img001.png" alt="YOLO"></td>
      <td>= two octaves higher</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>sometimes there's also <span><img src="imgs/8ve_higher.png" alt="YOLO"></span> = one octave higher.</p>
  <p>Besides conventional pitches one also encounters the following symbols:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="imgs/img002.png" alt="YOLO"></td>
      <td>= approximate pitch, the larger the x, the wider the tolerance.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="imgs/img003.png" alt="YOLO"></td>
      <td>= high (relative to the indicated string); very high; as high as possbile given arco pos. ord.; as high as possible given arco extr. sul pont. (fingering directly next to the hair of the bow)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="imgs/img004.png" alt="YOLO"></td>
      <td>= fingering which does not reflect the sounding result</td>

      <td>= sounding result which does not correspond to the given fingering</td>

      <td><img src="imgs/img006.png" alt="YOLO"></td>
      <td>= touch the string lightly as if executing a harmonic</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>These symbols appear in a great variety of combinations along with others still to be named. For the purpose of unifying this notation system, artificial harmonics will always look as follows:</p>

  <table class="artificial_harmonic">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="imgs/artificial_harmonic.png" alt="YOLO"></td>
      <td>

It may well be that IV in the tuning box sounds higher than III due to the shorter distance to the tuning peg, assuming that the strings are not crossed over. However, the prescribed strings are not arbitrary; they determine (due to the different thicknesses of the strings) differing degrees of noisiness, and, on each string, recognizably identical results.</td>

  <p>all pressure-sounds are meant not as 'expression', not brutal or violent, but rather technical/instrumental, as 'concrete sounds', as the sound material of absolute music without a programmatic content. The loveliest results (always deep and rattling, not high and squeaky) can be achieved through a carefully heard, judiciously balanced relationship between bow length, bow direction and pressure (not too high), and by bowing closer to the fingerboard than usual.</p>
